# Introduction

The development of open-source AI models is often hindered by the lack of high-quality human-generated datasets. Closed-source AI developers, aiming to reduce data collection costs, have created significant social and economic equity challenges, with workers being paid less than $2 per hour for mentally and emotionally taxing tasks. The benefits of these models have been concentrated among a select few, exacerbating inequalities among contributors.

The solution lies in creating an open platform to gather human-generated datasets, allowing anyone to earn by contributing their intelligence. This approach, however, introduces new challenges, such as performing quality control, verifying that contributions are genuinely human and preventing sybil attacks.

Enter Tensorplex Dojo ‚Äî an open platform designed to crowdsource high-quality human-generated datasets. Powered by Bittensor, the Dojo Subnet addresses these challenges with several key features such as Synthetic Task Generation, Obfuscation and in the future, Proof of Stake.

The Dojo Subnet offers multiple use cases:

- Synthetically generated tasks: These tasks can bootstrap the human participant pool and also can be used for model training or fine-tuning from the get go.

- Cross-subnet validation: Validators can use responses to rate the quality of outputs across other Bittensor subnets, thereby incentivising the miners to improve their performance.

- External data acquisition: Entities outside the Bittensor ecosystem can tap into the subnet to acquire high-quality human-generated data.

By democratising the collection of human preference data, the Dojo Subnet not only addresses existing equity issues but also paves the way for more inclusive and ethical AI development.

## Benefits to participants contributing through Dojo

- Open platform: Anyone capable can contribute, ensuring broad participation and diverse data collection.

- Flexible work environment: Participants enjoy the freedom to work on tasks at their convenience from any location.

- Quick payment: Rewards are streamed consistently to participants, as long as they complete sufficient tasks within a stipulated deadline and have them accepted by the subnet.

# Getting Started

To get started as a miner or validator, these are the common steps both a miner and validator have to go through.

> The following guide is tailored for distributions utilizing APT as the package manager. Adjust the installation steps as per the requirements of your system.
>
> We will utilize ~/opt directory as our preferred location in this guide.

Install PM2 (**If not already installed**)

```bash
cd dojo/scripts/setup/
./install_pm2.sh
```

Install Docker (**If not already installed**)

```bash
./install_docker.sh
```

Clone the project, set up and configure python virtual environment

```bash
# In this guide, we will utilize the ~/opt directory as our preferred location.
cd ~/opt

# Clone the project
git clone --recurse-submodules -j$(nproc) https://github.com/tensorplex-labs/dojo.git
cd dojo/

# Set up python virtual environment and pip packages
# Here we use venv for managing python versions

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
# for developers, install the extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Mining

Activate the python virtual environment

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Create your wallets and register them to our subnet

```bash
# create your wallets
btcli wallet new_coldkey

btcli wallet new_hotkey

# register your wallet to our subnet
# Testnet
btcli s register --wallet.name coldkey --wallet.hotkey hotkey --netuid 98 --subtensor.network test
```

Retrieve the API Key and Subscription Key with Dojo CLI

```bash
# Start the dojo cli tool
# Upon starting the CLI it will ask if you wanna use the default path for bittensor wallets, which is `~/.bittensor/wallets/`.
# If you want to use a different path, please enter 'n' and then specify the path when prompted.
dojo

# TIP: During the whole process, you could actually use tab-completion to display the options, so you don't have to remember them all. Please TAB your way guys! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
# It should be prompting you to enter you coldkey and hotkey
# After entering the coldkey and hotkey, you should be in the command line interface for dojo, please authenticate by running the following command.
# You should see a message saying "‚úÖ Wallet coldkey name and hotkey name set successfully."
authenticate

# Afterwards, please generate an API Key with the following command.
# You should see a message saying:  "‚úÖ All API keys: ['sk-<KEY>]". Displaying a list of your API Keys.
api_key generate

# Lastly, please generate a Subscription Key with the following command.
# You should see a message saying:  "‚úÖ All Subscription keys: ['sk-<KEY>]". Displaying a list of your Subscription Keys.
subscription_key generate

# :rocket: You should now have all the required keys, and be able to start mining.

# Other commands available to the CLI:
# You can always run the following command to get your current keys.
api_key list
subscription_key list

# You can also delete your keys with the following commands.
api_key delete
subscription_key delete
```

Create .env file

```bash
# copy .env.miner.example
cp .env.miner.example .env

# ENV's that needs to be filled for miners:
DOJO_API_KEY="sk-<KEY>"
DOJO_API_BASE_URL="https://dojo-api-testnet.tensorplex.ai"
```

Start the miner by running the following commands:

### Using pm2

```bash
# For Testnet
pm2 start main_miner.py \
--name dojo-miner \
--interpreter env/bin/python3 \
-- --netuid 98 \
--wallet.name coldkey \
--wallet.hotkey hotkey \
--logging.debug \
--axon.port 9602 \
--neuron.type miner \
--scoring_method "dojo" \
--subtensor.network test
```

### Using docker

# for testnet

```bash
MINER_ARGS="--netuid 98 --wallet.name coldkey --wallet.hotkey hotkey --logging.debug --axon.port 9602 --neuron.type miner --scoring_method dojo --subtensor.network test" docker compose -f docker-compose-miner.yaml up
```

### Setup Subscription Key for Miners on UI to connect to Dojo Subnet for scoring

Note: URLs are different for devnet, testnet and mainnet.
Testnet: https://dojo-api-testnet.tensorplex.ai
Mainnet: **_REMOVED_**

1. Head to https://dojo-testnet.tensorplex.ai and login and sign with your Metamask wallet.

- You'll see an empty homepage with no Tasks, and a "Connect" button on the top right ![image](./assets/ui/homepage.png)
- Click on "Connect" and you'll see a popup with different wallets for you to connect to ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_popup.jpg)
- Click "Next" and "Continue", then finally it will be requesting a signature from your wallet, please sign and it will be connected. ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_sign.jpg)
- Once connected, the top navigation bar should display your wallet address. ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_connected.png)

2. Once connected, please stay connected to your wallet and click on "Enter Subscription Key". ![image](./assets/subscription/enter_subscription.png)

- Give your subscription a name, and enter your subscription key generated earlier before running the miner. _*Refer to step 4 of "Getting Started" if you need to retrieve your key*_ ![image](./assets/subscription/enter_details.png)
- Click "Create" and your subscription will be saved. ![image](./assets/subscription/created_details.png)
- Confirmed your subscription is created properly, and that you can view your tasks! ![image](./assets/subscription/tasks_shown.png)

Congratulations, you magnificent mining maestroüßô! Grab your virtual pickaxe and let the digital gold rush begin! üöÄüî•
